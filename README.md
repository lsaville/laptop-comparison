# Summary

- Either machine's OS will need to be wiped in favor of Arch Linux (for auditing purposes)
- These comparisons were made on the fly, there is a slightly cheaper System76 model at 14" (the [Galago](https://system76.com/laptops/galago))... I'm not sure what specifications yall would be into on the Dell machine to begin with.
- There is some potential that I'd be able to pick the laptop up in Denver (System76 is headquartered in Denver) instead of having to ship it. I've sent an email to System76 to see if this is possible.
